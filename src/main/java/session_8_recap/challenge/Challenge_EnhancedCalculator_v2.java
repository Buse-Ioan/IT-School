    User should pe prompted with a message to enter two numbers for the mathematical operation.
    User should pe prompted with a message to enter the operator that he wants to use (+,-,*,/)
    Consider some validations in case the user doesnâ€™t enter a proper number value:
    -	The number is too large
    -	The format in not the one we expect
    -	Any other edge case you can think of
    -	Instruct the user what he has to do, with a message, if he finds himself on the edge case
    After the operation is complete, the user should have the option to either enter 2 other numbers from another mathematical operations, or exit the program. */
